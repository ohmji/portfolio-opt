## 🌱 Why this project exists

This project didn’t begin in a finance lab or on Wall Street.  
It started from watching a friend build something cool — a portfolio analysis tool — and thinking:

**“Maybe it’s time I tried building one too.”**

I’ve always been curious about investing and quant strategies, but this time I wanted to go deeper.  
Not just reading or paper-trading — but writing code, testing ideas, and learning by doing.

This repo is my way of exploring portfolio optimisation,  
and improving both my coding skills 🧠 and financial understanding 💰 along the way.
