## Academic Papers

- **Harry Markowitz (1952)** – “Portfolio Selection,” *The Journal of Finance*.  The paper that put the Efficient Frontier on the map.  
- **William F. Sharpe (1994)** – “The Sharpe Ratio,” *The Journal of Portfolio Management*.  Our yard‑stick for risk‑adjusted returns.  
- **Eugene F. Fama & Kenneth R. French (1993)** – “Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds,” *Journal of Financial Economics*.  A factor lens that still shapes today’s screening models.

## Practitioner & Blog Posts

- **AQR Capital Management** – “Myth‑Busting with the Efficient Frontier” (2018).  Clear prose on why volatility alone isn’t the boogeyman.  
- **QuantConnect Blog** – “Building a Risk‑Targeted Portfolio with CVaR” (2021).  Sparked the CVaR angle in our back‑tester.  
- **Corey Hoffstein, Newfound Research** – “Understanding the Risk of Risk Parity” (2016).  Guided the margin‑per‑year concentration check.

## Tools & Libraries

| Tool | Why it mattered |
|------|-----------------|
| **VectorBT** | Event‑driven back‑testing that kept the feedback loop snappy. |
| **CVXPY** | Convex optimisation without the headache. |
| **Pandas & NumPy** | Bread‑and‑butter for data wrangling. |
| **Matplotlib** | Old‑school visuals that just work. |

## Honorable Mentions

- **Yahoo Finance API** – Free data that didn’t bail at 3 a.m. test runs.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Where half the ideas were born (and promptly broken).  
- **Figma** – Quick mock‑ups so non‑quants could “see” the numbers before they existed.
